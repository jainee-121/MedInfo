                                            <b>Chemical Structure</b><br>
                                            <div> Methyl salicylate is derived from salicylic acid, with a methyl group (-CH3) substituted at the hydroxyl (-OH) group of the carboxylic acid functional group. It is also known as oil of wintergreen due to its natural occurrence in the wintergreen plant.
                                            </div>
                                            <b>Mechanism of Action</b><br>
                                            <div>When applied topically, methyl salicylate is absorbed through the skin and acts as a counterirritant, producing a warming or cooling sensation that temporarily distracts from underlying pain. It also has mild anti-inflammatory properties, which can further contribute to pain relief.
                                            </div>
                                            <b>Natural Source</b><br>
                                            <div>Methyl salicylate occurs naturally in various plants, including wintergreen, birch, and sweetgum. It contributes to the characteristic scent and flavor of these plants.
                                            </div>
                                            <b>Uses</b><br>
                                            <div> Methyl salicylate is primarily used as a topical analgesic and rubefacient. It is commonly found in over-the-counter pain relief products such as muscle rubs, liniments, and topical creams for relieving minor aches and pains associated with conditions like muscle strains, arthritis, and backaches.
                                            </div>
                                            <b>Toxicity</b><br>
                                            <div>While methyl salicylate is generally considered safe when used as directed, excessive ingestion or absorption through the skin can lead to salicylate poisoning, characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, and respiratory distress. Severe cases may result in metabolic acidosis, central nervous system effects, and even death.
                                            </div>
                                            <b>Synthesis</b><br>
                                            <div>Methyl salicylate can be synthesized through esterification of salicylic acid with methanol under acidic conditions or by extraction from natural sources.
