                                      Azithromycin is an antibiotic medication belonging to the class of macrolides.

                                  <b>Chemical Structure</b><br>
                                  <div>Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin and is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic. Its chemical name is 9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin A.Cetirizine belongs to the class of piperazine derivatives and is chemically designated as (Â±)-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid dihydrochloride.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Mechanism of Action</b><br>
                                  <div> Azithromycin works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis through binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms. By interfering with protein synthesis, it prevents the growth and multiplication of bacteria.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Pharmacokinetics</b><br>
                                  <div> Azithromycin is well-absorbed after oral administration and achieves high concentrations in tissues, making it suitable for once-daily dosing. It has a long half-life, allowing for shorter treatment durations, typically ranging from 3 to 5 days.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Indication</b><br>
                                  <div> Azithromycin is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections including respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis; skin and soft tissue infections; sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia and gonorrhea; and certain types of bacterial conjunctivitis.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Side Effects</b><br>
                                  <div>Common side effects of azithromycin include gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. It may also cause headache, dizziness, and changes in taste perception. Serious side effects such as allergic reactions and cardiac arrhythmias are rare but can occur.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Special Populations</b><br>
                                  <div> Azithromycin is generally considered safe for use in most populations, including children and pregnant women. However, caution is advised in patients with known allergies to macrolide antibiotics or pre-existing liver or kidney conditions.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Drug Interactions</b><br>
                                  <div>Azithromycin may interact with other medications, particularly those that affect the liver enzymes responsible for its metabolism. Concurrent use with drugs like warfarin or digoxin may require dosage adjustments due to potential interactions.
                                  </div>
