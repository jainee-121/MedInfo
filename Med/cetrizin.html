                                      Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine used primarily for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), urticaria (hives), and other allergic reactions. It is sold under various brand names such as Zyrtec, and it is available over-the-counter in many countries. Here's a brief overview of cetirizine:

                              <hr>
                              <div id="drug-facts" class="section">
                                  <b>Chemical Structure</b><br>
                                  <div>Cetirizine belongs to the class of piperazine derivatives and is chemically designated as (Â±)-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid dihydrochloride.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Mechanism of Action</b><br>
                                  <div> Cetirizine acts as a selective antagonist of peripheral H1 receptors. By blocking the histamine from binding to these receptors, cetirizine prevents the allergic response mediated by histamine, thereby alleviating symptoms such as itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Pharmacokinetics</b><br>
                                  <div>Cetirizine is well-absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 1 hour. It has a half-life of approximately 8-10 hours in adults and 6 hours in children. The drug is primarily metabolized in the liver and eliminated through urine and feces.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Clinical Uses</b><br>
                                  <div>Cetirizine is commonly used for the symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis, and chronic idiopathic urticaria. It is effective in reducing symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, itching, and watery eyes associated with allergic reactions.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Side Effects</b><br>
                                  <div>Common side effects of cetirizine include drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, headache, and gastrointestinal disturbances. However, compared to first-generation antihistamines, cetirizine causes less sedation due to its low affinity for crossing the blood-brain barrier.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Special Populations</b><br>
                                  <div>Cetirizine is generally considered safe for use in adults and children over the age of 2. However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment, as dosage adjustments may be necessary.
                                  </div>
                                  <b>Drug Interactions</b><br>
                                  <div>Cetirizine may interact with other medications, particularly those that depress the central nervous system. Concurrent use with alcohol or other CNS depressants can potentiate sedative effects.
